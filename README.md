React Analytics Demo
==============

A homework assignment I gave students this semester

Getting started:

1. [Install postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial-install.html)
2. clone this repository
3. start postgres
4. `npm start`

It's possible you'll need to make a postgres database for your user (or set your env variables for
another database).

To add events, refresh index.html or visit test.html
